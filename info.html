         <b>bonjour. I am Ayena. (ayena32)</b> I like tech, history, geography, cricket, politics, finance, media, and food. That
         is a lot of things but I still like them all. I daily drive a Samsung Galaxy S8+ as my main/only phone and it's not
         actually that bad. I also use an Asus ROG Ally. Recently I started getting into aviation as well. I am a Muslim living
         in a foreign, non-Muslim country and it's actually quite nice to live there, I even got a passport in that country.
         Mostly self taught in coding and I have a passion for Windows and Android. Currently I speak English, Bangla (both fluent),
         French and Spanish.<br/>
        <b>About Fart Technologies: </b> We don't actually manufacture technology (FOR NOW). Fart Technologies is currently a 
        nonprofit publishing tech news, reviews, articles, and recipes.<br/>
        <b>Why the name Fart Technologies?</b> It's not a stupid immature thing or whatever, it's actually an acronym that coincidentally
        spells "fart": <b>Finding Absolutely Random Things</b> <br/>
        </p>
        <br/>
        <b>Farts are actually one of the most misunderstood things in human history, and i'm tired of pretending they're not elite. society wants us to believe farts are bad, embarrassing or something we should fear. But use your brain for a second. if you're farting your body is literally working as intended. no farts is when you should start praying.
First of all, farts are a health check. your stomach is basically saying yeah i'm processing this food, relax. Holding in a fart is actual psychological torture, like your whole brain shuts down, your'e not thinking about maths or life or dreams, you're just fighting demons internally. the second you let it out its peace, clarity, enlightenment. suddenly you can hear colors again
Second, farts are free stress relief. people pay for therapy, meanwhile your body just goes pfffft and fixes the problem. that release does something to your soul. its like your organs sigh in relief. anyone who says they dont feel better after farting is 101% lying.
Farts also keep people humble and I think thats beautiful, you could be the most serious, locked in professional person ever. one fart and boom you're human again. no aura, no mystique, just vibes. Farts do not care about status, money, or followers. Everyone farts. kings farted, presidents fart, your favorite celebrity ripped one and blamed the dog.
and don't even get me started on comedy. Farts are universally funny. does not matter how old you are. one well timed fart noise and the room is DONE. people who say fart jokes arent funny are just lying to fit in. deep down they're giggling.
Farts are also brutally honest. you can lie with words but your stomach will expose you immediately. ate something questionable? Your gut is about to broadcast that information to everyone nearby. that's accountability. that's consequences. that's character growth.
Also, farts are natural. no artificial chemicals. no corporate nonsense. just raw organic vibes, straight from the source. The fart is an underrated legend of everyday life. While society pretends it doesn't exist, Gen Z already knows: the fart is basic. It's the most honest sound in the universe. It doesn't lie, it doesn't pretend, it doesn't sell courses. It just comes out and says, "I'm here." In a world of fakes and filters, such sincerity is a rare vibe.
First, the fart is freedom of expression. The body literally drops the soundtrack of the moment, and no social norms can completely control it. It's like a spontaneous meme that pops up without a script. Sometimes it's quiet and modest, sometimes loud and dramatic—an entire concert without tickets. And yes, the reaction of the people around you is pure laughter. Some pretend nothing happened, some blush, and some just die laughing. A social experiment at its most basic.
Second, the fart is health. A truly imba fact: if the body is getting rid of excess, it means it's working. A fart is a system notification that says "everything's ok." Ignoring it is like closing an antivirus. So respecting farts means respecting your body. A healthy lifestyle, but without the pathos.
Thirdly, a fart is a community. In a close circle, farts bring people together. If you can laugh about it together, that's it, you're one of them. This is a level of trust that can't be bought. A true crush is someone with whom you're not afraid to be fully human, not a picture-perfect person.
Finally, a fart is a stress reliever. In a world of deadlines, news, and constant anxiety, it reminds you: life is simple and absurd, and that's okay. Sometimes the best way to cope is to simply laugh at the most basic things. So yes, farts are the best. And that's not up for debate.</b>
