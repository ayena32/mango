This website is the official website for **Fart Technologies**.

Farts are actually one of the most misunderstood things in human history, and i'm tired of pretending they're not elite. society wants us to believe farts are bad, embarrassing or something we should fear. But use your brain for a second. if you're farting your body is literally working as intended. no farts is when you should start praying.
First of all, farts are a health check. your stomach is basically saying yeah i'm processing this food, relax. Holding in a fart is actual psychological torture, like your whole brain shuts down, your'e not thinking about maths or life or dreams, you're just fighting demons internally. the second you let it out its peace, clarity, enlightenment. suddenly you can hear colors again
Second, farts are free stress relief. people pay for therapy, meanwhile your body just goes pfffft and fixes the problem. that release does something to your soul. its like your organs sigh in relief. anyone who says they dont feel better after farting is 101% lying.
Farts also keep people humble and I think thats beautiful, you could be the most serious, locked in professional person ever. one fart and boom you're human again. no aura, no mystique, just vibes. Farts do not care about status, money, or followers. Everyone farts. kings farted, presidents fart, your favorite celebrity ripped one and blamed the dog.
and don't even get me started on comedy. Farts are universally funny. does not matter how old you are. one well timed fart noise and the room is DONE. people who say fart jokes arent funny are just lying to fit in. deep down they're giggling.
Farts are also brutally honest. you can lie with words but your stomach will expose you immediately. ate something questionable? Your gut is about to broadcast that information to everyone nearby. that's accountability. that's consequences. that's character growth.
Also, farts are natural. no artificial chemicals. no corporate nonsense. just raw organic vibes, straight from the source.
